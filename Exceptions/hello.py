# SyntaxError: is a common error that occurs when the Python interpreter parses your code and finds incorrect code that does not conform to the syntax rules.
# ValueError: The ValueError exception indicates that a function received an argument of the correct data type; however, the value itself is invalid.
# NameError: Python raises a NameError if you attempt to use an identifier that hasn't been defined or might be out of scope. Other potential causes of a NameError include referencing a variable before its assignment or misspelling an identifier.
